# Problem Statement
**This project aims to reduce economic disparities in the United States by using data analysis to identify groups of people who are at risk of poverty or financial struggles. We will use clustering and classification techniques to group people based on their education, healthcare access, and other factors, and evaluate the effectiveness of our models using accuracy and F1 score. The insights we gain will help non-profits, policymakers, and government agencies develop targeted interventions and policies to promote economic equity and help those who need it most.**
